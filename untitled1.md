### Reflection
In this assignment, I learned how to process multiple datasets and extract
specific sequence motifs ("GT" and "AG"). A motif is a short recurring 
pattern in biological sequences (like DNA or RNA) that has functional 
importance. For example, "GT" is a common donor splice site motif and 
"AG" is a common acceptor splice site motif.  

I used Pandas string operations to count their occurrences and Matplotlib 
to visualize the results using two different types of plots. This assignment 
strengthened my ability to handle biological data, automate repetitive tasks 
across files, and present insights visually.
